# BMPMOT
BMPMan One Touch, quick and easy data injection

This is a trimmed down and more efficient version of my original GUI based BMP injector. The difference is quite significant, as the original, on an SSD, took between 30 seconds and a minute per gigabyte. This new version should offer processing around 1 gigabyte per 5 or so seconds. This edition does not have user settings and won't store anything in your HOME folder. All needed information will be stored in a bmpfile (meta). Eventually, this meta file will store all the necessary to verify and build files, but for now, it's just needed for the name. Images should work on any site allowing BMP but in the future, custom chunk sizes will be allowed and embedded in meta to cover more platforms than Google.
